# **Alzheimer's Cognitive Assessment Tools**

This repository provides an overview of two key assessment tools used in the evaluation of cognitive impairment, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's disease: the Alzheimer's Questionnaire (AQ) and the Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE).

These documents are published by the Government of British Columbia and serve as guidelines for practitioners.

## **1\. Alzheimer's Questionnaire (AQ©)**

The Alzheimer's Questionnaire (AQ©) is a screening tool designed to assess various aspects of an individual's cognitive and functional abilities. It is intended to be administered by a clinician to a reliable informant (someone who knows the patient well) to gauge changes in the patient's current status compared to their previous level of function.

### **Key Features:**

* Format: Consists of 21 "yes/no" questions.  
* Areas Assessed: Covers domains such as:  
  * Memory  
  * Orientation  
  * Functional ability  
  * Visuospatial skills  
  * Language  
* Scoring:  
  * Each "yes" answer contributes to the total score.  
  * The total score ranges from 0 to 27\.  
  * Interpretation of Scores:  
    * ≤4: Considered normal cognitive function.  
    * 5−14: Suggests mild cognitive impairment.  
    * ≥15: Suggests dementia.

## **2\. Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE)**

The Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE) is a widely used brief cognitive screening tool. It assesses various cognitive functions and is typically administered directly to the patient. The provided document outlines the guidelines for its administration and scoring.

### **Key Features:**

* Purpose: To assess a person's cognitive function across several domains.  
* Administration: Detailed guidelines are provided for preparing the person, introducing the questionnaire, and asking the questions effectively.  
* Equipment Needed: A watch, a pencil, and specific pages with instructions and designs are required for administration.  
* Areas Assessed: Includes questions and tasks to evaluate:  
  * Orientation to time and place  
  * Memory (registration and recall)  
  * Attention and calculation  
  * Language (naming, repetition, comprehension, writing)  
  * Constructional ability (copying a design)  
* Scoring: Includes specific instructions for scoring tasks like WORLD reversal, sentence writing, and design copying. The document also provides tables that define stages of cognitive impairment based on SMMSE scores.
