# Research Focus:  Clock Drawing Test (CDT) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)

This document summarizes two primary areas of research within our broader project on early detection of Alzheimer's, Dementia, and Parkinson's disease. These two components are part of a larger interdisciplinary study being conducted by our team, focusing on identifying early markers for cognitive decline.

## 1. Clock Drawing Test (CDT)

### Objective
To investigate the utility of the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) as a screening tool for early cognitive impairment. CDT is a neuropsychological instrument often used to assess visual-spatial and executive functioning.

### Research Goals
- Analyze variations in clock drawings among healthy individuals, MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment), and patients with Alzheimer's or Parkinsonâ€™s.
- Identify stroke patterns and structural anomalies that correlate with cognitive disorders.
- Assess effectiveness of CDT as a non-invasive, low-cost, digital screening tool.

## 2. Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)

### Objective
To study the role of geriatric depression in mimicking or masking cognitive disorders and to evaluate GDS as a differential screening mechanism.

### Research Goals
- Analyze correlation between GDS scores and cognitive assessment outcomes.
- Explore whether depression may lead to misdiagnosis of dementia.
- Examine GDS as a co-screening method in elderly populations alongside neurocognitive assessments.

### Data Sources
- **ADNI Dataset** ([ADNI](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/))

> These two domains form a foundational part of our broader study on early detection, which includes additional tests and behavioral assessments currently under active investigation by our research team.
